# django-blog
This Blog was created using Django, Django Rest Framework, React Js
The blog api was created into another repository and as such needed to complete the whole django-react blog, 
the blog api was added to the MyBlog repo using git command: git submodule add <remote-url> destination-folder
ps: the destination-folder will be created as a new directory to push in the incoming submodule
